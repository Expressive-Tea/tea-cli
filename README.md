<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Create an Expressive Tea server-side application with no build configuration with different flavors (templates). With this tool, you will not need to set up any tool or package; just run this, and you are good to go.

**Notice:** This is our first alpha version of this tool and is considered a work-in-progress stage; Even if this tool is useful to create new applications, it can fail or change behavior following implementations. Use it for production at your own risk.



### Built With

* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [ShellJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shelljs)
* [Caporal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/caporal)
